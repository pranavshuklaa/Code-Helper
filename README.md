# Code-Helper
This is a fun little Chrome extension that reminds you to study every time you open a new tab.

## 📝How it works

The extension works by injecting a content script into every page you visit. The content script sends a message to the background script, which then fetches the current URL and sends it back to the content script. The content script then sends a message to the popup script, which displays a reminder to study.
